abstract = {We present HeadBlaster, a novel wearable technology that creates motion perception by applying ungrounded force to the head to stimulate the vestibular and proprioception sensory systems. Compared to motion platforms that tilt the body, HeadBlaster more closely approximates how lateral inertial and centrifugal forces are felt during real motion to provide more persistent motion perception. In addition, because HeadBlaster only actuates the head rather than the entire body, it eliminates the mechanical motion platforms that users must be constrained to, which improves user mobility and enables room-scale VR experiences. We designed a wearable HeadBlaster system with 6 air nozzles integrated into a VR headset, using compressed air jets to provide persistent, lateral propulsion forces. By controlling multiple air jets, it is able to create the perception of lateral acceleration in 360 degrees. We conducted a series of perception and human-factor studies to quantify the head movement, the persistence of perceived acceleration, and the minimal level of detectable forces. We then explored the user experience of HeadBlaster through two VR applications: a custom surfing game, and a commercial driving simulator together with a commercial motion platform. Study results showed that HeadBlaster provided significantly longer perceived duration of acceleration than motion platforms. It also significantly improved realism and immersion, and was preferred by users compared to using VR alone. In addition, it can be used in conjunction with motion platforms to further augment the user experience.},

abstract = {JetController is a novel haptic technology capable of supporting high-speed and persistent 3-DoF ungrounded force feedback. It uses high-speed pneumatic solenoid valves to modulate compressed air to achieve 20-50Hz of full impulses at 4.0-1.0N, and combines multiple air propulsion jets to generate 3-DoF force feedback. Compared to propeller-based approaches, JetController supports 10-30 times faster impulse frequency, and its handheld device is significantly lighter and more compact. JetController supports a wide range of haptic events in games and VR experiences, from firing automatic weapons in games like Halo (15Hz) to slicing fruits in Fruit Ninja (up to 45Hz). To evaluate JetController, we integrated our prototype with two popular VR games, Half-life: Alyx and Beat Saber, to support a variety of 3D interactions. Study results showed that JetController significantly improved realism, enjoyment, and overall experience compared to commercial vibrating controllers, and was preferred by most participants. },

abstract = {Strength training improves overall health, well-being, physical appearance, and sports performance, with training programs specifying variables such as sets, repetitions, rest time, weight, and tempo. The repetitive nature of strength training, typically performed at fixed tempo, has made it challenging to develop entertaining exergames for common strength training exercises. We present StrengthGaming, which uses scaling and shuffling technique to provide tempo variations to strength training while preserving the training volume and training goals. It affords game designers more flexibility in designing strength training-based exergames. We developed a prototype game, inspired by FlappyBird, that uses a wearable orientation sensor to track the repetition tempo to control a flying character, using both fixed tempo design and dynamic tempo design. Results from our 24-person user study showed that dynamic tempo was significantly more entertaining than fixed tempo (p&lt;0.01), and was preferred by participants. },

abstract = {Teleportation, which instantly moves users from their current location to the target location, has become the most popular locomotion technique in VR games. It enables fast navigation with reduced VR sickness but results in significantly reduced immersion. We present HeadWind, a novel approach to improve the experience of teleportation by simulating the haptic sensation of air drag when rapidly moving through the air in real life. Specifically, HeadWind modulates bursts of compressed air to the face and uses multiple nozzles to provide directional cues. To design the wearable device and to model airflow speed and duration for teleportation, we conducted three formative studies and a design session. User experience evaluation with 24 participants showed that HeadWind significantly improved realism, immersion, and enjoyment of teleportation in VR (p&lt;.01) with large effect sizes (r&gt;0.5), and was preferred by 96% of participants. },

abstract = { Attention-management tools can restrict online communication, but may cause collateral damage to their users’ fulfillment of communication expectations. This paper explores the idea of integrating attention management into instant messaging (IM), by 1) disclosing restriction status via an online status indicator (OSI) to manage contacts’ expectations, and 2) imposing communication limits to reduce communication distraction. We used a speed-dating design method to allow 43 participants to rapidly compare 48 types of OSI restriction in various conversational contexts. We identified two “tug-of-wars” that take place when attention management is integrated into IM apps: one between fulfilling one’s contacts’ expectations and protecting one’s own attention, and the other, between protecting one’s privacy and asserting the justifiability of using communication restrictions. We also highlighted the participants’ desire to be diplomatic for sustaining their positive images and maintaining relational connectedness. Finally, we provide design recommendations for integrating attention management into IM apps. },

abstract = { Optical illusions have been brought into recent video games to enhance gaming experiences. However, a large corpus of optical illusions remains unused, while few games incorporate illusions seamlessly. To mitigate the gap, we propose a workflow to guide game designers in applying optical illusions to their video games, i.e., in making more illusion games. In particular, our workflow consists of 5 stages: (1) choosing a game object, (2) searching for a matching illusion, (3) selecting an illusion mechanic, (4) integrating the selected illusion into the game, and (5) optionally revealing the illusion. To facilitate our workflow, we provide a tag database with 163 illusions that are labeled by their in-game visual elements and desired effects. We also provide example editing interfaces of 6 illusions for game designers. We walk through our workflow and showcase 6 resulting illusion games. We implemented these 6 games (with and without illusion) and conducted a 12-participant study to gain a preliminary understanding of how illusions enhance gaming experiences. To evaluate our workflow, we invited 6 game designers and 6 experienced players to follow our workflow and design their own illusion games, where 3 experienced game designers completed 2-week in-depth developments. We report their games, qualitative feedback and discuss reflection on our workflow, database and editing interfaces.},

abstract = { Haptic feedback significantly enhances virtual experiences. However, supporting haptics currently requires modifying the codebase, making it impractical to add haptics to popular, high-quality experiences such as best selling games, which are typically closed-source. We present HapticSeer, a multi-channel, black-box, platform-agnostic approach to detecting game events for real-time haptic feedback. The approach is based on two key insights: 1) all games have 3 types of data streams: video, audio, and controller I/O, that can be analyzed in real-time to detect game events, and 2) a small number of user interface design patterns are reused across most games, so that event detectors can be reused effectively. We developed an open-source HapticSeer framework and implemented several real-time event detectors for commercial PC and VR games. We validated system correctness and real-time performance, and discuss feedback from several haptics developers that used the HapticSeer framework to integrate research and commercial haptic devices.},
