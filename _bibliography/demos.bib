  abstract = {JetController is a novel haptic technology capable of supporting high-speed and persistent 3-DoF ungrounded force feedback. It uses high-speed pneumatic solenoid valves to modulate compressed air to achieve 20-50Hz of full impulses at 4.0-1.0N and combines multiple air propulsion jets to generate 3-DoF force feedback. Compared to propeller-based approaches, JetController is more than 10 times faster in impulse frequency, and its handheld device is significantly lighter and more compact. JetController supports a wide range of haptic events in games and VR experiences, from firing automatic weapons in games like Halo to cutting fruits in Fruit Ninja. To discuss the differences between JetController and vibrotactile feedback approaches, we designed a new prototype based on PS5 Controller, DualSense&nbsp;[1]. There are three haptic approaches in our demonstration, JetController, Adaptive Trigger, and regular vibration feedback. We provide two scenarios, driving with tactile (surface texture) feedback and shooting with recoil feedback. },

  abstract = {JetController is a novel high-speed, persistent 3-DoF ungrounded force feedback controller. It uses high-speed pneumatic solenoid valves to modulate compressed air to achieve full impulses of 50Hz at 1.0N (20Hz at 4.0N), and combines multiple air propulsion jets to generate 3-DoF ungrounded force feedback. Compared to propeller-based approaches, JetController supports 10-30 times faster impulse frequency, and its handheld device is significantly lighter and more compact. JetController enables a wide range of haptic events in games and VR experiences, from firing automatic weapons in games like Halo (15Hz) to slicing fruits in Fruit Ninja in 3-DoF (up to 45Hz). To demonstrate JetController, we integrated our prototype with two best-selling VR games, Half-life: Alyx and Fruit Ninja VR, to highlight a variety of 3-DoF interactions that were not possible before. },

  abstract = {Strength training improves overall health, well-being, physical appearance, and sports performance, with training programs specifying variables such as sets, repetitions, rest time, weight, and tempo. The repetitive nature of strength training, typically performed at fixed tempo, has made it challenging to develop entertaining exergames for common strength training exercises. We present StrengthGaming, which uses scaling and shuffling technique to provide tempo variations to strength training while preserving the training volume and training goals. We developed a prototype game, inspired by FlappyBird, that uses a wearable orientation sensor to track the repetition tempo to control a flying character, using both fixed tempo design and dynamic tempo design. },
