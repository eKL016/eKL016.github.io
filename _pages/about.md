I am a software engineer currently working at [Siemens EDA (ex-Mentor Graphics Corp.)](https://eda.sw.siemens.com/en-US/). After work, I am still involved in side projects related to CSCW/UIST research.

Previously, I received my master's degree in computer science from National Taiwan University, where I was advised by [Prof. Mike Y. Chen](https://mikechen.com/) and contributed to a series of UIST-themed projects.

After graduating from NTU, I worked as a research assistant with [Prof. Yung-Ju Chang](https://www.armuro.info/) at National Chiao Tung University for a semester, which allowed me to gain a better understanding of the pan-HCI community and resulted in my first successfully published CSCW paper in CHI '22.

My research interests included developing novel haptic technologies and creating developer tools for developers. Nonetheless, I have recently begun to investigate new opportunities in CSCW, which is a challenging but exciting topic for me.
