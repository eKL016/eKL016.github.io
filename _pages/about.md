I am an experienced engineer and researcher working with [Dr. Yung-Ju Chang](https://www.armuro.info/) at National Chiao Tung University as a research assistant. 

Previously, I earned my master's degree in computer science from National Taiwan University under the supervision of [Dr. Mike Y. Chen](https://mikechen.com/). 
My research interests were inventing novel haptic technologies and creating developer tools for developers. I am recently exploring new opportunities in CSCW, which is a challenging yet exciting topic to me.

**Looking for a fully-funded PhD position starting from Fall '23.**
