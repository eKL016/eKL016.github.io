I am an experienced engineer and researcher working as a research assistant with [Dr. Yung-Ju Chang](https://www.armuro.info/) at National Chiao Tung University.

Previously, I received my master's degree in computer science from National Taiwan University, where I was mentored by [Dr. Mike Y. Chen](https://mikechen.com/).

My research interests included developing novel haptic technologies and creating developer tools for developers. Nonetheless, I have recently begun to investigate new opportunities in CSCW, which is a challenging but exciting topic for me.

**Looking for a fully-funded PhD position starting in the fall of '23.**
